	<h3>WHO AM I? </h3>
	<p>I am a 23 year old aspiring Software Engineer, I just completed my Software Engineering bootcamp at Hyperion Development.
		   Software engineering and Software development has been a passion of mine for a long time, from the first "hello world" code to more complex codes I loved writing code and solving problems.
		   I try to code my own little projects as hobbies outside of the bootcamp and in my free time to improve my skills even more.
		   Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving.
